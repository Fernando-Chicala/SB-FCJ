# FCJ
Develop by: Fernando Chicala Jr.
In this web-based project I used Html, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap for their development and design: 
I used Html for structure, CSS (Bootstrap) for style, and JavaScript (JQuery) for component manipulation and functions.
I used the Bootstrap template for design. 
Demo projects can be altered depending on the stakeholder required and the government and bank policies.
