Develop by: Fernando Chicala Jr.
On this project which is web based I used Html, Css, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap for their development and design: 
I used Html for structure, Css (Bootstrap) for style, JavaScript (JQuery) for component manipulation and functions.
I used Bootstrap template for design. 
This is a demo project which can be altered depending on the stakeholder required and the government and bank policies.
